# Getting started with Okteto

This guide shows you how to get started with [Okteto](https://okteto.com). It'll take less than 5 minutes to have you developing a go-based application directly in your Kubernetes cluster. 

While you're going through the tutorial, you might want to join [Okteto's channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/CM1QMQGS0/) in the [Kubernetes slack](http://slack.k8s.io/) for technical support, or just to say hi ðŸ˜¸.

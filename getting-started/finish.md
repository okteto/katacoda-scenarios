Okteto helps you move your entire development workflow to Kubernetes. This way you can:
- Eliminate integration issues by developing the same way your application runs in production.
- Uninstall Docker or Minikube. No more cpu cycles wasted in your machine.
- Hardware and network just limited by the power of the cloud!
- Your development endpoints are always available. No need to expose your local machine to the internet through remote tunnels.

Now that you just developed your first application directly in the cluster with Okteto! Now is a great time to explore [our other examples](https://okteto.com/docs/samples), or [to talk to us](https://twitter.com/oktetohq) about your use cases.
